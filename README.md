# leg

Command line tool that helps you make step-by-step programming walkthroughs.

**NOTE:** This project is in a *very* unstable state at the moment. If you really want to use the last "stable" version of this project, head over to the [`snaptoken`](https://github.com/yjerem/leg/tree/snaptoken) branch. (Just know that it will be replaced by a completely new tool and file format in the near future.)

## Install

    $ gem install leg

## Usage

See the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)!

# Leg

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/leg`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'leg'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install leg

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
