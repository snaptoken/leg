# leg

Command line tool that helps you make step-by-step programming walkthroughs.

**NOTE:** This project is in a *very* unstable state at the moment. If you really want to use the last "stable" version of this project, head over to the [`snaptoken`](https://github.com/yjerem/leg/tree/snaptoken) branch. (Just know that it will be replaced by a completely new tool and file format in the near future.)

## Install

    $ gem install leg

## Usage

See the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)!
